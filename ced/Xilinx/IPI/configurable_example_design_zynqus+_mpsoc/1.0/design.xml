<Description>
This is an MPSoC based system. Users can select the peripherals among DDR4, UART, and GPIO. When DDR4 is chosen the software code can be built to execute out of DDR4. To write software application, the user has to export the Hardware to SDK and build the software application project in SDK. There is no test bench support. This example design is targeted for UltraScale devices and needs to have UltraScale devices installed before using it.
